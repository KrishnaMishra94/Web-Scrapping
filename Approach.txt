Approach Towards the Problem:

1. No Static Site:
	> Since the site is not a static site. It has used Javascript to show content on the page.
	> Static Scraping [For e.g. one using Python's BeautifulSoup] completely ignores Javascript.
	> As the content [Job Postings] we are looking for is not available through static scraping. 

2. Dynamic Scraping:
	> Dynamic Scraping uses actual browser and performs the simulation of Javascript rendering.

3. Use of Selenium:
	> Though developed for Testing, it's also the perfect tool for Web scraping.
	> Ease of usability of Selenium in Python.
